## CRUD API
This one is a little different. I have created an API that doesn't require any credentials. You can do full CRUD as long as you follow my rules. The api is https://ca-sample-api.herokuapp.com/things

There is a video (no audio sorry) of how it works that can be found [here](https://youtu.be/K51HMC5AhUQ)
